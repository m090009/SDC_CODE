# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Define a function, search() that returns a list
# in the form of [optimal path length, row, col]. For
# the grid shown below, your function should output
# [11, 4, 5].
#
# If there is no valid path from the start point
# to the goal, your function should return the string
# 'fail'
# ----------

# Grid format:
#   0 = Navigable space
#   1 = Occupied space
